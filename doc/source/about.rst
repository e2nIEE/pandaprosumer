pandaprosumer is an open-source modeling tool, that enables modeling of sector-coupling prosumer components in energy systems.
The framework comes with a library of different predefined sector-coupling components, but also enables users to create
own components based on the pandaprosumer framework.
It also comes with a logic to simulate different combinations of these components with each other and different
inputs (e.g. a heat demand timeseries) and outputs (e.g. power load timeseries on the powergrid).

It extends the libraries `pandapower <http://pandapower.org>`_ and `pandapipes <https:/pandapipes.org>`_ ,
was created at Universit√§t Kassel, Fraunhofer IEE and has received support from the European Institute for Energy Research in the frame of the "Senergy Nets" project, funded by the European Union.
