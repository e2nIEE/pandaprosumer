Pandaprosumer is a library directly inspired by Pandapower and Pandapipes for the modelling of energy systems, especially sector coupling elements. It is
still firmly work-in-progress.

Getting started:

- `Documentation <https://pandaprosumer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
- `Tutorials on github <https://github.com/e2nIEE/pandaprosumer/tree/master/tutorials>`_

## Credits

Pandaprosumer was created at Uni Kassel and EIFER and has received support from the European Institute for Energy Research in the
frame of the "Senergy Nets" project, funded by the European Union.
