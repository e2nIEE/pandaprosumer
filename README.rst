# Pandaprosumer

Pandaprosumer is a library directly inspired by Pandapower and Pandapipes for the modelling of energy systems, especially sector coupling elements. It is
still firmly work-in-progress.

## Examples

Examples can be found in `./tutorials`

## Documentation

Documentation is built using Sphinx. To build:

```sh
cd docs
make clean; make html
```

You can then access it at [https://pandaprosumer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://pandaprosumer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Credits

Pandaprosumer was created at Uni Kassel and EIFER and has received support from the European Institute for Energy Research in the
frame of the "Senergy Nets" project, funded by the European Union.
